# hello-world
My first GitHub repository

Mike here, I am new to the coding world but not to the tech world. I've been a technology enthusiast (especially computers) all my life. I was born in the early 80's- the NES era. I've always wanted to learn how to write code in any language so one day I was browsing YouTube and came acorss a course, of sorts, and the channel was named Barnacules. He inspired me to teach myself. Check him out sometime it's a cool channel!
